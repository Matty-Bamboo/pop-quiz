# Coding Quiz

## Desciption
A timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions

I started this project by walking through the create a quiz on kindson the genius website and later worked with a few tutors to build upon it.  I was never able to get it working - the timer function seemed to be the problem as it worked until I started adding that feature - I ran out of time to try and debug.
